# My Favourite Things
## About
Life is to be enjoyed not endured!<br>
So with that in mind I decided to create a Gallery of Joy....<br>
A selection of things in life that I like!<br><br>
This is my first ever Web Site, built after learning HTML & CSS for 2 weeks at Boolean-UK<br>
Hosted at: https://friendly-jackson-148e71.netlify.app/
